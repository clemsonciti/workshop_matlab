MATLAB stands for "matrix laboratory"; it's a programming language which has been optimized for working with matrices. Matrices are a very common way to represent data, and, therefore, MATLAB is quite efficient for the purpose of building models that describe our data. Because of this, it is used extensively in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. 

MATLAB is very attractive for scientific programming: on one hand, it has the power of statistical software (like SAS or SPSS); on the other hand, it is a fully developed and flexible programming language, with basic features such as loops and conditional statements, as well as sophisticated features like object-oriented programming (for those so inclined). As a programming language, it is quite intuituve and easy to learn, especially if you have familiarity with linear algebra. Another attractive feature of MATLAB is its visualization tools for displaying the results of the analysis.

MATLAB is licensed. Many universities, such as Clemson, have university-wide MATLAB license. MATLAB is self-contained: once you install MALAB, you typically don't need to worry about packages (as you would in R or Python). It comes with its own environment for editing, debugging, and plotting. It comes with great documentation. Also, there is a very active online Matlab community. If you have a problem, there is a high chance that somebody has already solved it and posted the solution online.

For pratical purposes, MATLAB is quite similar to R. The advantage over R is that you do't need to worry about installing packages and matching the versions of packages. The disadvantage is that MATLAB is not free and requires a license.
